🌌 Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🚀
This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The goal is to build a simple CNN model that can classify digits (0-9) with high accuracy. 🌠

Steps Taken:
Dataset: The MNIST dataset, containing images of handwritten digits, is loaded and preprocessed:
Images are normalized to pixel values between 0 and 1. 🪐
The data is reshaped to fit the input requirements of the model. 🌍
Labels (digit classes) are one-hot encoded. 🌟
Model Architecture:
A Sequential model is created using layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense to process and classify the images. 🌜
The final layer uses softmax activation to output predictions for the 10 digit classes. 🚀
Model Training:
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained using categorical crossentropy as the loss function. 🌙
The model is evaluated on the test set to calculate its accuracy. 🌝
Prediction on New Images:
The model can predict digits from new images provided by the user. 🌠
For single or multiple images, preprocessing steps like resizing, normalizing, and reshaping are applied before making predictions. 🌌
The predictions are then displayed alongside the input image. ✨
Technologies Used:
TensorFlow (for model building and training) 🚀
Keras (high-level API for model layers and utilities) 🌙
OpenCV (for image preprocessing) 🌜
Matplotlib (for displaying images) 🌟
How to Use:
Upload your own images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). 🪐
The model will predict the digit from the image. 🌍
The prediction results will be displayed in the console. 🌝
